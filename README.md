# Wedding

Wedding is an (incomplete) WebAssembly Module Linker that focuses on linking
incompatible modules. This project was created to serve a personal need that,
apparently, existing linkers do not fulfill. Thus, only a subset of the current
WebAssembly specification is implemented and features are developed as needed.
